Examples
--------
You can find an examples of how to use the package under ``peripy/examples/``.

There are two examples that will output mesh files that can be viewed in `Paraview <https://www.paraview.org/>`_.

Example 1
^^^^^^^^^

Run the first example by typing ``python peripy/examples/example1/example.py``

Example 1 is a simple, 2D peridynamics simulation example.
This example is a 1.0m x 1.0m 2D plate with a central pre-crack subjected to
uniform velocity displacements on the left-hand side and right-hand side of
2.5x10^-6 metres per time-step. The ``--opencl`` argument toggles between OpenCL
and cython implementations. The ``--profile`` argument generates profiling information for the example.

Example 2
^^^^^^^^^

Run the second example by typing ``python peripy/examples/example2/example.py``

Example 2 is a simple, 3D peridynamics simulation example.
This example is a 1.65m x 0.25m x 0.6m plain concrete canteliver beam with no
pre-crack subjected to force controlled loading on the  right-hand side of the
beam which linearly increases up to 45kN.
In this example, the first time the volume, family and connectivity of the
model are calculated, they are also stored in file '1650beam13539_model.h5'.
In subsequent simulations, the arrays are loaded from this h5 file instead of
being calculated again, therefore reducing the overhead of initiating the
model. The ``--profile`` argument generates profiling information for the example

Example 3
^^^^^^^^^

Run the third example by typing ``python peripy/examples/example3/example_trilinear.py``

Example 3 demonstrates the simulation of a simply supported unnotched plain concrete beam in three-point bending. The chosen problem was tested experimentally by Grégoire et al. [1]. The problem is simulated using a 3D model and a trilinear constitutive model. The numerical load-CMOD curve is compared against the experimental data...

The Model class
---------------
The :class:`peripy.model.Model` class allows users to define a bond-based
peridynamics model for composite materials with non-linear micromodulus
functions, stiffness correction factors and boundary conditions. The model
is defined by parameters and a set of initial conditions (coordinates,
connectivity and optionally bond_types and stiffness_corrections). For this an
:class:`peripy.integrators.Integrator` is required, and optionally
functions implementing the boundarys.

The Integrator class
--------------------

The :class:`peripy.integrators.Integrator` is the explicit time
integration method, see :mod:`peripy.integrators` for options.
Any integrator with the suffix 'CL' uses OpenCL kernels to calculate the
bond force and displacement update, resulting in orders of magnitude faster
simulation time when compared to using the cython implementation,
:class:`peripy.integrators.Euler`. OpenCL is 'heterogeneous' which
means the 'CL' integrator classes will work on a CPU device as well as a
GPU device. The preferable (faster) CL device will be chosen automatically.

    >>> from peridynamics import Model
    >>> from  peripy.integrators import EulerCL
    >>>
    >>> def is_displacement_boundary(x):
    >>>     # Node does not live on a boundary
    >>>     bnd = [None, None, None]
    >>>     # Node does live on a boundary
    >>>     if x[0] < 1.5 * 0.1:
    >>>         # These displacement boundary conditions
    >>>         # are applied in the negative x direction
    >>>         bnd[0] = -1
    >>>     elif x[0] > 1.0 - 1.5 * 0.1:
    >>>         # These displacement boundary conditions
    >>>         # are applied in the positive x direction
    >>>         bnd[0] = 1
    >>>     return bnd
    >>>
    >>> # for the cython implementation, use euler = Euler(dt)
    >>> euler = EulerCL(dt=1e-3)
    >>>
    >>> model = Model(
    >>>     mesh_file,
    >>>     integrator=euler,
    >>>     horizon=0.1,
    >>>     critical_stretch=0.005,
    >>>     bond_stiffness=18.00 * 0.05 / (np.pi * 0.1**4),
    >>>     is_displacement_boundary=is_displacement_boundary,
    >>>     )

Defining a crack
----------------

To define a crack in the inital configuration, you may supply a list of
pairs of nodes between which the crack is.

    >>> initial_crack = [(1,2), (5,7), (3,9)]
    >>> model = Model(
    >>>     mesh_file,
    >>>     integrator=euler,
    >>>     horizon=0.1,
    >>>     critical_stretch=0.005,
    >>>     bond_stiffness=18.00 * 0.05 / (np.pi * 0.1**4),
    >>>     is_displacement_boundary=is_displacement_boundary,
    >>>     initial_crack=initial_crack
    >>>     )

If it is more convenient to define the crack as a function you may also
pass a function to the constructor which takes the array of coordinates as
its only argument and returns a list of tuples as described above. The
:func:`peripy.model.initial_crack_helper` decorator has been provided
to easily create a function of the correct form from one which tests a
single pair of node coordinates and returns `True` or `False`.

    >>> from peridynamics import initial_crack_helper
    >>>
    >>> @initial_crack_helper
    >>> def initial_crack(x, y):
    >>>     ...
    >>>     if crack:
    >>>         return True
    >>>     else:
    >>>         return False
    >>>
    >>> model = Model(
    >>>     mesh_file,
    >>>     integrator=euler,
    >>>     horizon=0.1,
    >>>     critical_stretch=0.005,
    >>>     bond_stiffness=18.00 * 0.05 / (np.pi * 0.1**4),
    >>>     is_displacement_boundary=is_displacement_boundary,
    >>>     initial_crack=initial_crack
    >>>     )

Conducting a simulation
-----------------------

The :meth:`peripy.model.Model.simulate` method can be used to conduct a
peridynamics simulation. Here it is possible to define the boundary condition
magnitude throughout the simulation.

    >>> model = Model(...)
    >>>
    >>> # Number of time-steps
    >>> steps = 1000
    >>>
    >>> # Boundary condition magnitude throughout the simulation
    >>> displacement_bc_array = np.linspace(2.5e-6, 2.5e-3, steps)
    >>>
    >>> (u,
    >>>  ud,
    >>>  udd,
    >>>  force,
    >>>  body_force,
    >>>  damage,
    >>>  nlist,
    >>>  n_neigh) = model.simulate(
    >>>     steps=steps,
    >>>     displacement_bc_magnitudes=displacement_bc_array,
    >>>     write=100
    >>>     )

Conducting a simulation with initial conditions
-----------------------------------------------

It is possible to define initial conditions such as the
displacement vector `u`, the velocity vector `ud` and the
`connectivity` which is a `tuple`, (`nlist`, `n_neigh`). In
this example the first 1000 steps have been simulated,
generating the initial conditions for the next 1000 steps.
The first step has been set to 1000 in the second simulation.

    >>> model = Model(...)
    >>>
    >>> # Number of time-steps
    >>> steps = 1000
    >>>
    >>> # Boundary condition magnitude throughout the simulation
    >>> displacement_bc_array = np.linspace(2.5e-6, 2.5e-3, steps)
    >>>
    >>>  (u,
    >>>  ud,
    >>>  udd,
    >>>  force,
    >>>  body_force,
    >>>  damage,
    >>>  nlist,
    >>>  n_neigh) = model.simulate(
    >>>      ...displacement_bc_magnitudes=displacement_bc_array,
    >>>      ...)
    >>>
    >>> # Boundary condition magnitude throughout the simulation
    >>> displacement_bc_array = np.linspace(2.5025e-3, 5.0e-3, steps)
    >>>
    >>> u, *_ = model.simulate(
    >>>     u=u,
    >>>     ud=ud,
    >>>     connectivity=(nlist, n_neigh),
    >>>     steps=steps,
    >>>     first_step=1000,
    >>>     displacement_bc_magnitudes=displacement_bc_array,
    >>>     write=100
    >>>     )
